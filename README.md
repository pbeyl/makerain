This is a Arduino 4 channel irrigation system Project. 

It is currently still a work in progress and needs more time to complete.

Core components include
- Arduino Uno
- 2.8" Nextion UTFT NX3224T028
- Real Time Clock - DS1307
- 4 Channel Relay
- Solenoid Valves

I built this project using Arduino Uno but ran into memory constraints, so I also need to look into a different MCU to complete the project.
